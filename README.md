## Project Name

Predicting Enron Spam Emails (Junk Messages) using Supervised Learning

## Description

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to build a spam email classifier which automatically detects spam emails (junk messages). It is the final project of the [DS-GA 1001: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/briandalessandro/DataScienceCourse) course at New York University. 

### Business Problem

Spam electric males have become a serious issue in today's online world. Spam mails are junk or unsolicited messages designed and distributed for commercial purposes. Email spam not only negatively affects customer experience. It also wastes limited internet resources. A major email service provider is suffering from high-level email spam. The company is constantly losing customers. Users report that they receive too many spam emails daily. The company wants to design a classifier to filter the spam emails out from the users and to prevent potential financial losses.

### Use Scenario

Using machine learning techniques to train a classifier that automatically identifies and filters spam emails for users.

### Trained Models

1. Logistic regression with elastic net (Baseline)

2. Random Forest (Bagging)

3. Support Vector Machine (Boosting)

4. Naive Bayes

5. Multilayer perceptron (Neural Network)

6. Gradient boosting machine

### Grading

We use AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) scores to measure model performance. Additionally, we apply confusion matrix to visualize model accuracy.
